# Self Organising Map Challenge
This repo contains my analysis and corrections of the kohonen algorithm, provided by Mantel as part of a technical challenge for the role of Machine Learning Engineer.

If you want to execute the notebook, make sure you have `Python 3.11.14` and a virtual environment to install the dependencies from `requirements.txt` (to be honest I'm not using anything fancy, so chances are that you already have all dependencies ready to hit play).

Please open the jupyter notebook `kohonen.ipynb` and all the instructions will be there.
